## Security Practices

To ensure the security of this project, we follow these practices:

- **Code Reviews:** All code changes are peer-reviewed to detect potential security issues early in the development process.
- **Dependency Management:** We regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Our continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines include security checks and tests.
- **Configuration Management:** We enforce secure default configurations and provide guidelines for secure deployments.

## Security Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- **API Authentication:** Our REST APIs are secured using API keys or OAuth tokens to ensure only authorized users can access the endpoints.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different roles and permissions are enforced to ensure users have the minimum required access.

### Data Protection

- **Encryption:** All sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- **Secure Storage:** Credentials and other sensitive information are stored securely using environment variables and secrets management tools.

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Audit Logs:** Comprehensive logging of all access and changes to the system is enabled to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring is in place to identify and mitigate potential security threats in real time.
